            <p> Age: 26<br>
                Race: Human/Superhuman <br>

                Original author of "Three Ways to Survive the Apocalyptic World". <br>
                After finishing the novel for almost 9 years, her story became reality; however, it resulted in her forgetting she's the author. 
                She turns into a normal person striving to survive her own story. She became Kim Dokja's companion and aided him whenever he was in big trouble.
                She also relies on Kim Dokja's knowledge in order to survive in the new world.
            </p>
            <p>
                She has signed a contract with the constellation "Black Dragon". With the power the "Black Dragon" gave her, she became
                an outstanding teammate of Kim Dokja. This allowed her to completely outmatch some of her opponents. After losing the ownership of her own story,
                the story itself gave her a different power. This power allows her to create a clone of herself to avoid any troubles.
