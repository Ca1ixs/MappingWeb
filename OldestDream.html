                The "Oldest Dream" the world's most omniscient yet powerless god. The "Oldest Dream" is Kim Dokja himself, the past him that
                dream to be able to escape the harsh and abusive life he been through. Everything that is happening in the story are because of him,
                if he wakes up the whole timeline will be frozen living all the people unable to move or even think.
            </p>
            <p>
               Later on in the story in order to free the "Oldest Dream" from all the suffering and give him a better life, Kim Dokja replace him in
               his position instead. He did this to avoid the world from being frozen in time and allow the story to keep on going even if the price
               is eternal slumber.
