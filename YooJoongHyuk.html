                The main character of "Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World" who became a companion of
                Kim Dokja. He has the power to regress whenever he's in a brink of death, allowing him to turn back time.

                In the original story "Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World", he had regressed 2000+ times, which led him
                to witness the deaths of all his companions and comrades in various ways. However, after the novel story became a reality,
                his memories of his previous life in the world seem to have changed due to all the alterations made by Kim Dokja.
